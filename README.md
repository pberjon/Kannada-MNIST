This is a proposition of a solution of the Kaggle Competition Kannada MNIST.
The goal of this competition is to provide a simple extension to the classic MNIST competition we're all familiar with.
Instead of using Arabic numerals, it uses a recently-released dataset of Kannada digits.

This competition uses the same format as the MNIST competition in terms of how the data is structured, 
but it's different in that it is a synchronous re-run Kernels competition. 
You write your code in a Kaggle Notebook, and when you submit the results, 
your code is scored on both the public test set, as well as a private (unseen) test set.
